Before I started studying JavaScript, my only experience of web design was the *'Black Goose Bakery'* in Jennifer Neiderst Robbins' **Learning Web Design**. As such, I admit that I would be more excited to attack projects *other* than fake bistro pages. This particular project will therefore be very simple, and lacks responsive media queries. I went down the animation and transition rabbit hole on my last project, so this serves simply as a proof of ability to use npm and webpack.

As much as possible, I've tried to keep the element generation code DRY and function-dependent. I thought it would also be nice to populate the menu from an array imported from a separate file, so that menu items could be modified and updated independent of all of the DOM manipulation code. I'm sure there would be an even easier way to keep the menu easily maintainable by the restaurant, which I would pursue on a longer project."
